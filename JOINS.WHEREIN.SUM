Here is a SQL query that identifies the top 5 customers from the top 10 cities whoâ€™ve paid the highest total amounts to the company.

SELECT A.customer_id,
	A.first_name,
	A.last_name,
	C.city,
	D.country,
	SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid	
	FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_id= E.customer_id
WHERE C.city IN ('Aurora', 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Ambattur', 'Shanwei', 'So Leopoldo', 'Teboksary', 'Tianjin', 'Cianjur')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city
