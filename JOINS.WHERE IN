Here is a SQL query that identifies the top 10 cities within the top 10 countries that I identified in the JOINS file
This query uses JOIN and WHERE IN

SELECT D.country, C.city, COUNT (customer_id) as customers 
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B. ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE D.country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Turkey', 'Brazil')
ORDER BY customers DESC, city ASC
LIMIT 10
